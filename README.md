# Tic-Tac_Toe
It's a game of tic-tac-toe, you put a number and press enter then it places the X or 0 for you, while playing it if you give a number that's already been played it ask you to play a diffrent number and likewise if you give a letter it will tell you to give a number. It keeps track of who win and who loose and when the game is over it ask you if you want to play again if you say yes/Y it restart the game if you say no/N it stops the game.
To play the game you need to have the person your playing against to be next to you and take turn puting a number from 1-9 or 0-8
